Consider this: God has revealed himself to us through a story, and that story is the grounds of our formation into Christ-likeness. That may sound odd to you, especially if you’ve never thought about the power of story-telling before. But stories are powerful vehicles for truth, and as Jesus said, …the truth will set you free (John 8:32).

###Story Does not Equal Fiction
What comes to mind when you hear the word ‘story?’ Some—most?—probably think of some work of fiction, perhaps a novel, or the fairy-tales that many of us were told growing up. But even fictional stories contain powerful truths. Fairy-tales were vehicles for morality. Novels move us and invoke our emotions.

Our familiarity with these types of stories sometimes hides a very important fact: a story is not always fiction. A story is simply a narrative of events, agnostic to whether what is communicated is truth or fiction. Biographies, for example, are stories of true events. Much of the Old Testament is story-driven; the gospels are very similar in the New Testament. Neither, the Christian faith holds, are fiction, but they are stories none-the-less. 

###Stories Are Formative
Stories—whether fictitious or not—have always been formative. When was say that something is <q>formative,</q> what we mean is that it gives something its shape; it forms or molds its object. 

Formative story-telling is nothing new; Stories have been used in formation all through human history. For example, civilizations and cultures have always used them to tell their origins and teach their customs and beliefs. The earliest form of these cultural narratives were spoken, memorized, and passed down from generation to generation. Eventually, oral tradition gave way to written tradition, and the skill of oral story telling (and memorizing) dimmed. It did not entirely die out, however, as some cultures continue to utilize both.

We also see the formative power of narratives in corporate story-telling, a form of communication that companies are using more and more. In corporate story-telling, companies take facts—their history, their product, and the perceived need they see in the world—and tell the narrative of their reason for existing. Corporate story-telling is formative by design, serving to unite the employees behind a common vision and purpose, and communicating to others why they should invest in their product. It cultivates a sense of belonging and need. It transforms what people value.

When stories come together—stories of origins, beliefs, and history—they form a <q>meta-narrative</q>. Each meta-narrative is actually a story of stories; an overarching story to show how all the other stories fit together and make sense of the world.

###The Bible – A Story of Stories
God has revealed himself in a story—the Bible. The Bible is the meta-narrative of how God redeems sinners. This story encapsulates all of human history, from the beginning of history at creation to its future close and consummation when Christ returns. It is the narrative of God’s reign and rule, his kingdom. And like all kingdoms, God’s kingdom has a culture whose foundation, customs, and beliefs are given through stories.

As a meta-narrative the story of redemption contains many other stories connected together like acts in a play. We have the story of Creation and the Fall of Humanity, Cain and Able, Noah, the flood, and re-creation. We have the story of Israel, from its founding in Abraham to the exodus out of Egypt, from its civic history to its fall and exile. We have the story of Jesus, the Messiah. We have the story of the early New Testament church in Acts, and Paul’s letters, written to occasions within the early church’s story. Finally, we have John’s Revelation, which tells the story of the church and the victory of Jesus over history, sin, death, and Satan.

###The Gospel is the Hinge of God’s Story
The gospel stands at the hinge of God’s story. From Genesis on, all of the Old Testament points to the gospel. The New Testament, however, is about how the gospel exploded into history and marches on until God brings history to a close, destroying Satan, sin, and death forever. All of history is shaped by this gospel.

We, too, are shaped by the gospel. This is why Paul continually brings his readers back to the gospel. Or, as Tim Keller has routinely said, The gospel is not the A,B,Cs of the Christian life, but the A to Z. It is the gospel which informs the cultural ethics and customs of God’s kingdom, and teaches us what we should believe and do.

The gospel changes us. We are not changed by some impersonal force called the gospel but through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, who works to intersect the gospel story with our stories, who awakens in us a knowledge of sin, a desire to repent, and the spiritual and kinesthetic power to step away from our sin and journey back toward God. The Spirit does this through a story. The story. And he does this in midst of our stories.
